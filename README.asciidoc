== Status

Please note that this repository is currently just evolving and work in progress.
You will also find parts in https://github.com/devonfw-sample/devon4quarkus-reference/[devon4quarkus-reference] that will move here over time.
Feel free to get in touch, contriubte and help us to make our quarkus support as great and production-ready as our spring-boot support.
